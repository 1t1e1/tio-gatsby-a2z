description: "Kanban is an organizing method that generally divides workload into columns as to do, doing, done. It is a dynamic method invented to help teams more efficiently complete their work. Rather than only doing a bit of work at a time, every column gives the team an idea of how much work is being accomplished at any given moment. This is best practice because it creates an awareness of how much work is being completed. "
